The currency app demonstrates how to implement videos-for-virtual currency (V4VC) to enable users to watch videos in return for in-app virtual currency rewards (with currency balances stored client-side). The Instant-Feed app demonstrates recommended usage of AdColony's native ad unit within the context of a social feed application.
